## How to play

* So how do you play this beautiful quiz game.
* It's just so simple so it's automated everything so all you need to do is to answer the questions on the quiz.
* And when the game is done you just simple click on the play again button, to go back to start again.

# Design

* In terms of user experience, a well-designed quiz form encourages engagement and completion. The blue background may help maintain a positive mood, while the white form offers a clean slate for users to input their responses. These design considerations collectively contribute to a visually pleasing and effective quiz interface

* The blue background is likely chosen for its psychological effects. Blue is often associated with calmness, serenity, and trust. It can evoke a sense of stability and reliability, which are desirable qualities in a quiz setting. This color choice may help create a comfortable environment for users, putting them at ease as they engage with the quiz.

## HTML Structure

* The HTML file likely contains elements like:
* An element with the ID "question" to display the quiz question.
* An element with the ID "answer-buttons" to display the answer options as buttons.
* A button with the ID "next-btn" to navigate to the next question.
* An element to display the timer, possibly with the ID "timer."

## JavaScript Logic

* An array named questions holds the quiz questions along with their answer options. Each question is an object with a "question" property and an "answers" array containing objects with "text" (answer text) and "correct" (whether the answer is correct) properties.
* Variables like questionElement, answerButtons, nextButton, currentQuestionIndex, score, timer, and seconds are declared to manage quiz state and user interaction.

## Functions

* runTimer() function:

* Sets up an interval timer to update the elapsed time and display it on the page.
startQuiz() function:

* Initiates the quiz by hiding the "Next" button, resetting the question index and score, and showing the first question.
showQuestion() function:

* Displays the current question and its answer options.
Adds event listeners to the answer buttons to handle user selection.
resetState() function:

* Clears the answer buttons, resetting their state for the next question.
selectAnswer(e) function:

* Handles the user's answer selection.
Checks if the selected answer is correct, updates the score, and applies visual feedback to the selected button.
Disables all buttons to prevent further interaction.
Sets a timeout to move to the next question after a brief delay.
showScore() function:

* Stops the timer.
Displays the user's score and the option to play again.
handleNextButton() function:

* Advances to the next question or shows the final score if there are no more questions.
displayTotalTime() function:

* Creates and appends an element displaying the total time taken to answer all questions.

## Event Listeners

* The "Next" button has an event listener to either move to the next question or restart the quiz, depending on the quiz state.

## Initialization

* The startQuiz() function is called to initialize the quiz when the page loads.

## Quiz Flow

1. User starts the quiz by clicking the "Next" button.

2. Questions are displayed one at a time.

3. User selects an answer.

4. Feedback is provided, and after a brief delay, the next question is shown.

5. After all questions are answered, the final score is displayed with an option to play again.

## Fixed bugs

* I fixed so the play again button not showing after the quiz is done and when you go back I had problem that play again button is stuck and by that i added the nextButton.style.display = "block" to the function

* Ive also took away the days and minute functions so it's only showed in seconds.

## Know Bugs

* They are no knowed bugs.

# Acknowledgments

* Slack for amazing support.
* My mentor again Antonio
* Also I know im very bad about commit trough this github ive been working on VScode, and I havent set up the github only the  code. So I cant push out there. I've been there for a while because It's so laggy on CodeAnywhere, with various bugs etc.
